# QueryBuilder
A humble but hopefully eloquent query builder for C#/.Net. Primary purpose is building SQL query statemeents from idiomatic C# code.

## Patterns and tools used:
[ ] Composite pattern to build an object graph representing a SQL-like query structure 
[ ] Opeator Overloading
[ ] Builder pattern, kind of
[ ] Visitor pattern for implementing Sql (and any other) represntations. Some research will be needed on my part to get to a satisfying solution here.
